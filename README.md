## Abstract

The existing $\LaTeX$ templates are often over-complicated, while I try to make them simple and unified. The following are templates you might need:

- [Note](./Note)
- [Report/Assignment](./Report)
- [Beamer](./Beamer) (🌽)
- [Resume](./Resume)
- [CV](./CV)
- [Letter](./Letter) (〽️)

where 〽️ means it's with UMich style, and 🌽 means it's with UIUC style. Feel free to change them by replacing figures and color theme.
