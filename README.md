### About Honor Code

If there is same questions or labs in the future, it is the responsibility of JI students not to copy or modify these codes, or TeX files because it is against the Honor Code. The owner of this repository dosen't take any commitment for other's faults.

According to the SJTU student handbook (2019 version),

> It is a violation of the Honor Code for students to submit, as their own, work that is not the result of their own labor and thoughts. This applies, in particular, to ideas, expressions or work obtained from other students as well as from books, the internet, and other sources. The failure to properly credit ideas, expressions or work from others is considered plagiarism.

## University of Michigan

### About Honor Code

According to the UM [Academic Rules, Rights and Responsibilities](https://bulletin.engin.umich.edu/rules/),

> It is always required that ideas and materials obtained from another student or from any other source be acknowledged in one’s work. The latter is particularly important, because material is so freely available on the Internet. According to Merriam-Webster online dictionary, to plagiarize is “To steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one’s own.” To avoid plagiarism, it is necessary to cite all sources of both ideas and direct quotations, including those found on the Internet.
